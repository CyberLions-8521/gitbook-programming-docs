This section will cover programming using REV Robotics' SparkMax motor controllers.

* Programming an AM14U6 drive base
  * Comes in the FRC Drivebase Kit + Black Tote + Kit of Parts
  * Using the controllers plugged into PWM ports on the robot controller (can be CIM or NEO)
  * Introduction to drivetrain kinematics and reverse kinematics
* Programming a generic mechanism that has a NEO motor
  * Using the CAN network and the vendor specific library: REV Lib
  * Learning to use the built-in NEO encoder
  * Learning motor configurations
  * Introduction to PID
