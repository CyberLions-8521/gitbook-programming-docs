# Functions README First

At the time of the current update of this documentation (mid-2025), the block-programming environments do not support using functions with Arduino boards.  TinkerCAD does not give an option for trying to create functions, and the "My Blocks" tab in mBlock (which are in fact, functions) does not work properly with Arduino.

{% hint style="warning" %}
TL;DR - Block-code functions for Arduino is currently not supported.  It is suggested that if you have been working with blocks, then now is a good time to start transitioning to text-based programming.  Feel free to redo any previous activities, or look at the additional information for Arduino C++ in the C++ code tabs in previous pages before moving on to the next page to learn about functions in programming.
