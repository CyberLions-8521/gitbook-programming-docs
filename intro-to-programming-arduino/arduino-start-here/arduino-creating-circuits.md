# Arduino Creating Circuits

## Basic Theory

A circuit is a group of electronic components that are connected together.  A circuit always starts at the positive side of its power source (e.g., the plus side of a battery), connects to any number of devices (lights, motors, sensors), and ends at the negative side of its power source (called "ground"; e.g., the minus side of a battery).

## Connecting our Components

As long as electrical components are connected to a power source's positive and negative terminals, electricity will run through it, and it will have power (it will turn on).  Usually, we use wires to connect our components.  These can be alligator clips, or "regular" jumper cables.  To help us build circuits, we will be using breadboards.  See the video below to learn how breadboards work.
