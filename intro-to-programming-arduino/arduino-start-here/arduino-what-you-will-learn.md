# Arduino: What you will Learn

We will learn the fundamentals of programming (and a little bit of electrical and circuits) through Arduino.  An Arduino is a microcontroller, and is a small computer than we can run programs on and control other electronic components such as lights and sensors.

## **What We will Learn**

* Programming basics - syntax, variables
* Conditional statements - if-statements; how to have programs "make decisions"
* Functions
* Encapsulation - organizing code into "bundles" that have data and perform tasks

## **Learning Pathways**

Depending on your programming experience, these are the recommended learning "pathways" to get the most out of these activities.  When programming in Arduino, you have the option of using block-based programming, or C++.

* **Little to No Programming Experience -** Start with block-based programming.  Once you get comfortable with programming on a conceptual level, you can redo the Programming Basics and Conditional Statements sections in C++ before finishing Functions and Encapsulation.
* **Some or Advanced Programming Experience -** You can go ahead and run through the activities in C++.

## How to Participate

* **Simulate Arduino online -** Use this option if you do not have a physical Arduino, or you want to test your circuit on simulation before running it on your physical hardware.  Supports both blocks and C++.\

* **Work with Physical Arduino -** Use this option if you have a physical Arduino, and cannot download and install software to your device (e.g., a school issued Chromebook).  Supports both blocks and C++.\

* **Arduino IDE -** Official Arduino programming environment.  Only supports C++.\
