# How to Use this Guide

## What this Guide Is

This guide attempts to walk you through how to program, and specifically, how to program robots for the _FIRST_<sup>_®_</sup> Robotics Competition (FRC).  However, you should not use this guide as your only reference and resource for learning how to program.

### Where to Start

* <mark style="color:red;">**Little to no experience**</mark> - Intro to Programming (Arduino) sections
* <mark style="color:red;">**Some experience**</mark> - Zero to Robot with XRP sections
* <mark style="color:red;">**Lots of programming experience**</mark>
  * If you are proficient with programming robots, you could probably just jump straight to Command Based Programming for FRC
    * Command Based Programming sections (WIP; coming later)
    * [WPILib documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/index.html)
    * [Team 3255's documentation](https://frcteam3255.github.io/FRC-Java-Tutorial/index.html)
    * [Team 5712's documentation](https://www.frc5712.com/)
  * If you were like me, and knew how to program in general, but needed to learn how the "code connected to the hardware", it might still be a good idea to skim over the Zero to Robot with XRP sections anyways.

### _FIRST_<sup>_®_</sup> Is _More Than Robots_<sup>SM</sup>

This guide should not necessarily be used as a substitute for Introduction to Programming or Programming 1 resources.  Many of the programming concepts (variables, conditional statements, functions, classes) are introduced at a _very surface level_.

Focusing only on "programming for FRC" will cause you to be able to program a robot specifically for FRC, but not know how or be able to program in general.

Some free resources include

* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Quick guide to many languages.
* [Learn.Java website](https://learn.java/learning/tutorials/) - Decent Java course
* [CSAwesome v2](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome2/csawesome2.html) - This "textbook" is meant for the AP CS A course and exam, but it still a good resource nonetheless, regardless of whether or not you're in the AP course of if you are an adult learner.
* [Cisco NetAcad C++ Essentials 1](https://www.netacad.com/courses/c-plus-plus-essentials-1?courseLang=en-US) - A good introduction is Modules 1 and 2, and functions from Module 3.  This particular course delves much deeper than what you would normally see in an introductory high school programming course, but is good for anyone looking to "level up" and deepen their knowledge of programming.
