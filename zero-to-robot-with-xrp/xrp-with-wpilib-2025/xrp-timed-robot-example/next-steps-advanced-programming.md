# Next Steps - Advanced Programming

Tutorials for some of these will get created soon, but some things you can start looking into are:

* Swerve drive - to prep for this, you can look into
  * Using inverse kinematics from the `DifferentialDrive` class to drive in an arcade drive method (instead of a tank drive method)
  * PID and closed loop control - Some ways to study this are
    * Using the XRP gyroscope to turn
    * Using the rangefinder to drive until a certain range
    * Using PID in combination with the `DifferentialDriveKinematics` class to drive in an arcade drive method
* Programming "actual" motors such as NEOs or Krakens
  * Running them
  * Configuring them
  * PID and closed loop control with them
* Command based programming
  * Creating subsystems
  * Creating commands
  * Binding commands to triggers (controller buttons and joysticks)
