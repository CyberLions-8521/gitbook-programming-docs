# Getting Started with XRP

To get started with the XRP Robot, make sure that you've downloaded and installed [WPILib version 2025 or later](../../../getting-started/frc-wpilib.md).

(Note: If you have already imaged the XRP, then you can skip this step, and move on.)

### Imaging the XRP with WPILib

Follow the instructions in the WPILib documentation below for assembling and imaging the XRP robot.  You only need to image the XRP one time.  If you have connected to the XRP via WiFi to test its connectivity, then make sure you disconnect from it before moving on so that you have access to the Internet.
